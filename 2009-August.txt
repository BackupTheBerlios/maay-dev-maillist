" "I don't admit an injustice. Besides, I don't see what you can know
about the matter." "A proper line to take with an outsider like myself;
but I know you were turned out of the army for a fault you did not
commit." Blake's face set sternly. "It's hard to understand how you
arrived at that flattering conclusion." "I won't explain, but I'm
convinced of its correctness," Clarke rejoined, watching him. "One would
imagine that the most important matter is that you were driven out of a
calling you liked and

Method has to be resorted to in order to enlist "interest." The
psychologized _is_ of interest--that is, it is placed in the whole of
conscious life so that it shares the worth of that life. But the
externally presented material, conceived and generated in standpoints
and attitudes remote from the child, and developed in motives alien to
him, has no such place of its own. Hence the recourse to adventitious
leverage to push it in, to factitious drill to drive it in, to
artificial bribe to lure it in. Three aspects of this recourse to
outside ways for giving the subject-matter some psychological meaning
may be worth mentioning. Familiarity breeds contempt, but it also breeds
something like affection. We get used to the chains we wear, and we miss
them when removed. 'Tis an old story that through custom we finally
embrace what at first wore a hideous mien. Unpleasant, because
meaningless, activities may get agreeable if long enough persisted in.
_It is possible for the mind to develop interest in a routine or
mechanical procedure if conditions are continually supplied which demand
that mode of operation and preclude any other sort._ I frequently hear
dulling devices and empty exercises defended and extolled because "the
children take such an 'interest' in them." Yes, that is the worst of it;
the mind, shut out from worthy employ and

The French term _petits fours_, may be given here. _Petits Fours._--Make
rich cake mixture thus: Wash three quarters of a pound of butter to free
it from excess of salt; squeeze it dry in a cloth; beat it with the hand
till creamy; add three quarters of a pound of powdered sugar; beat till
light; then beat in ten eggs, one by one, and sift in a pound of dried
and sifted flour. When all are well beaten together, the paste or batter
is ready for use. Line some shallow pans (those used for making rolled
jelly-cake are best) with buttered paper; spread a layer of the mixture
just as you would for jelly-cake, but much thicker, as when baked the
sheets should not be more than the third of an inch thick. Bake slowly.
When done, remove from the oven, but leave the cake undisturbed till
cold. If the sheets are large, they may be cut exactly in half, spread
thinly with some stiff marmalade or jelly; quince or apricot is best,
but any rich flavor with some tartness will do; lay one half on the
other, and press closely and very neatly together. Do each shee

 The people of Susa shouted and were glad. To the Jews there came light
and gladness and joy and honor. And in every country and city, where the
king's command came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, and a
holiday. On the fourteenth day of the month Adar, the Jews rested and
made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. Therefore the Jews who live in
the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar as a day
of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and as a day on which they send
gifts to one another. But the Jews in Susa rested on the fifteenth day
of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. The Jews
made it a custom for them, and for their children, and for all who
should join them, so that it might not be changed, that they should
observe these two days as feasts ea
