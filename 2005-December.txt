Subject: [Maay-dev] Maay 0.3.2
Message-ID: <20051201152410.GA13141@crater.logilab.fr>

A new release of Maay is available. This is a bugfix release which fixes
some problems with filenames using characters which are not legal in the
current filesystem encoding, which can happen when a partition from a
foreign filesystem is mounted and indexed by Maay. 

You can download it from https://developer.berlios.de/projects/maay/
